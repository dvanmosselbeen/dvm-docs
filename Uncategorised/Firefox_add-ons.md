# Firefox add-ons

There are some very interesting FireFox add-ons available on the Internet. You can mainly find add-ons on https://addons.mozilla.org. and browse the mozilla site to find the add-on that suit your needs. If you are a skilled programmer, you can even make your own addon and share it with the world wide web. Here's a list of some addons i use and install on some systems where FireFox is available:

* [It's all text](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125) - Some add-on which add a button to text areas. So that you can use your (defined) favorite text editor to fill in the text area.
* [SQLite Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5817) - An interface to work with SLQLite databases.
* [Web developer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60) - Must have add-on if you do some web development.

* [Littlefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/307) - Very small FireFox theme ideal for little screens. This is just a tweaked and smaller User Interface ui).
* [Stratine](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11435) - Another very small FireFox theme ideal for little screens. This one is much nicer to see as LittleFox and has the same size layout.
