*This page list all web framworks i found and have take a closer look to
it. This list won\'t sum all existing web frameworks that there are
available on the market at the moment.*

But what the hell is a web framework? A web framework is just a system,
a way, to glue togheter existing libraries, custom or not,
functionalities that can be shared. A framework will just aid you to
develop and will avoid that you may need to write some code for some
essential functionalitiess. It will probably also aid you to avoid to
write the same code again over and over. For example, you will have an
easy way to process templates, a login system, dabase connection,
database queries etc. In fact, the functionalities you will have at your
disposal depend of how complex the web framework is.
