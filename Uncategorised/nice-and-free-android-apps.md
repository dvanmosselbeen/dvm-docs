# Nice and free Android apps

There are tons and tons of different types of tools (applications) available on the Android Market for your smartphone. These applications will add some extra features on your smart phone or you can even install games. There are payware as well as free Android apps available. I have no experience in buying and using paid apps for Android. So here you will mainly find a list of free and cool apps for i found during my researches.

* [Tikl](http://www.appbrain.com/app/tikl-touch-to-talk-%28ptt%29/mobi.androidcloud.app.ptt.client) - Touch To Talk (PTT) (Talkie walk) app.
* [Skifta](http://www.skifta.com/download) - Some media client,  but couldn't find it on the Market. See upnplay her below as cool alternative. Maybe does Skifta require some recenter Android version.
* [UPnPlay](https://market.android.com/details?id=cx.hoohol.silanoid&hl=en) - Listen to the music of your UPnP(tm) / DLNA Media Server. (Video support via third party apps - it\'s up to you to install them) - This app is still in development, so there are glitches and probably serious bugs as well. Help improving the app! Please contact the
    dev.
