# Importing and organizing files

## Organisation methodology bins in the Project

It's wise to create a folder structure to put in your different kind of files. In Adobe terminology, a folder is called a `bin`. It's also wise to add a number to the bin as this will help us to sort on number names instead of by the alphabet and mix up everything.

* **01_Sequences** - To keep the most recent sequence.
  * **ARCHIVE** - The old, unused or previous sequences we don't use. Just to keep older stuff for in case of if we need to roll back.
* **02_VIDEO** - For the video files. It's wise to create sub folder in this when using multiple camera files. But also to designate smartphone videos, b-roll, screencast. A & B cam are used with multiples cameras (with sounds) are used to record to same video/audio at the same time but from another view. For example a camera (A CAM) in front and B CAM the screencast. 
  * **A CAM** - 
  * **B CAM**
* **03_AUDIO** - For the music tracks or even background music.
* **04_GFX** - For additional graphics text files made with for example Photoshop etc.
* **05_STILLS** - For any still images like photos, screenshots. Anything that can be jpg or png that will be used in the video.
* **06_MUSIC**
* **07_SFX** - Sound Effects
* **99_MISC** - Anything that does not fit in the rest.

# Sync Video and Audio

When you have different cameras, or by recording sound of the screencast at the same time, you need to sync the different video and audio's. This can be done manually or by using the magics of Adobe Premiere Pro.

By doing it manually, you should look to the audio peaks. A handy trick is to clap your hands at each start of a record, but also during recording when you know you did mistakes and need to cut of parts of the video. 

You can sync the audio by doing the magics of Adobe Premiere Pro. For this, select the concerned clips in the timeline and then right click and select in the context menu `Synchronize`. Then in that new window, check audio and select the Track Chanel number wich is the master.

# Multiples Cameras

For this, make sure that the audio of the different clips are synced. Then select the concerned video clips and right click and select Nest. Give a name to this, for example `Multicam`. Then right click on it and `Multi-Camera` > `Enable`. Now in the Monitor window, select that tool icon and there select `Multi-Camera`.

# Keyboard shortcuts
