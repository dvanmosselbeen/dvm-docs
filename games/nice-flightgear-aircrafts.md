This is my own list of prefered aircrafts that are available in the
FlightGear Flight Simulators. Just my little list of favorite aircrafts
or some details i like about some specific aircraft. My list is split by
aircraft type, which you can checkout on the table of content.

## General Aviation

    instruments vs 3D
-   C684 - Has cool default failure= if to much throttle..
-   carreidas - Has interesting modern instruments.

    some custom greay splashscreen background to check.

    interface; gps)

-   ATR-72-500

    forum post for latest version).
-   777-200ER (Which seems to have nice tutorials)

    however. Use the generic autopilot system. And no tutorials for it
    :/

-   Lockheed1049h - Very complete and beautiful cockpit. No tutorials
    and no autostartup.

    options to show up truck stairs, fuel tankers etc.

    or less complete.
-   CRJ700 (see also the CRJ700 & CRJ1000) - Very nice looking aircraft
    with a complete and nice looking cockpit. Also have a custom
    autopilot interface. Have tutorials (some tutorials seems to be only
    available in some version (ER & LR).
-   A380 ?? and that A320 ?? family

## Helicopters

-   aircrane -
-   alouette2-easy, alouette2F-easy - There\'s also a alouette2 and
    alouette2F but seems to be much more acurate, even if i find these
    last two unflyable.
-   Alouette-III - Kinda hard to fly but must by doable.
-   as332 - Hard to fly but maybe doable after some learn curve.
-   bo105
-   ch47
-   ec130 - Hard to fly but seems to be realistic. Has also a hard
    startup procedure!
-   ec135 - Easier to fly as the ec130 but has less features.
-   r22
-   raven (r44)
-   clipper (r44 with floats)
-   s76c - Have an awesome cockpit
-   uh1 - A bit hard to fly but cool model.

## Fighters

-   typhoon-2
-   f-14b - Must be the top fighter in fgfs.
-   f16
-   f4u - With a maybe to overrealistic fdm. Need to investigate if
    it\'s usable after a long flytime. Has also a propstrike failure,
    when to much throttle for long time.
-   harrier
-   hurricaneIIb
-   IAR80 - Probably the most advanced in high-tech aircraft
    (high-poly + dds textures.
-   lightning
-   sea-vixen

-   p47d-30 - Nice plane, tailwheel and make it hard to take off
    straith, but model and the basic interior is nice.

    sudden stall).
