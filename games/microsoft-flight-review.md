*Microsoft Flight is the next generation flight simulator. It is meant
to be replace the fabuouse Microsoft Flight X simulator. To be a joke,
or not to be a joke...*

Microsoft previously had a daghter company, Ace, responsible for it\'s
flight simulator. Microsoft closed that company and thus, have put all
workers of that company on the street. The reason for closing that
company is a bit obscure. It was like that Microsoft would leave the
flight simulator world being to expecive and less rentability. However,
later on, Microsoft decided to develop the flight simulator internally
in they Microsoft Studio. And that\'s what Microsoft Flight is the
result of.

Microsoft Flight is announced to be a free flight simulator. It is
indeed free to be donwloaded and you can start flying for free. I must
admit, after a very slow download and installing the stuff. I was
pretting surprised about how good the splash screen looks like. The main
game screen looks also very awesome. It really give the impression of
proffesional software. And i feel that a deep research on presentation
has been done.

However, the dedicated website just looks like this is al about a big a
trap. It\'s an one page website and there\'s no usable or detailled
information of the Microsoft Flight simulator. You can watch a 1 minute
and 20 seconds youtube video. Get a download button and three other
buttons giving you much less that the minimal information.
