# Introduction

FlightGear Flight simulator is an amazing flight simulator which is extremely configurable.

# Installing FlightGear

You have multiples ways to install FlightGear on your computer. You should refer to the installation instructions for your operating system.

However, you should be aware that FlightGear is available in different release versions. The official stable releases are most of the time very old and you probably want the latest features. So in this case, i recommend to install the FlightGear developers version.

## Installing FlightGear on Microsoft Windows

Installing FlightGear on Windows is easy. You have multiples options to chose which version you want to download. I recommend to install the minimalist (without fgdata) Nightly installer and clone the fgdata.

See here how to download both methods:

## Installing FlightGear on Debian GNU/Linux

You can use your package manager to install (an older version of) FlightGear or make use of that `download_and_compile` script.
