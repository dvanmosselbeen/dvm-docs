# Recover a corrupted Microsoft Outlook pst file

## Introduction

Microsoft Outlook store his data in a pst file. If this pst file is
bigger than 1 GB you have more chances that this file become corrupted.
Believe it or not, but a corrupted pst file happen much more than we
think. And this only happen, when it shouldn\'t happen! The good news is
that Microsoft provide a tool to fix this!

## Fix the pst file

To start the English scanpst click on `C:\Program Files\Common
Files\System\MSMAPI\1033\SCANPST.EXE`.

If you have the Windows XP language Packs (or Office??) you will have
the `scanpst.exe` installed in a different language. At `C:\Program
Files\Common Files\System\MSMAPI\1036\SCANPST.EXE` you will find
the French version of `scanpst.exe` or the German at `C:\Program
Files\Common Files\System\MSMAPI\1033\SCANPST.EXE` and finally
`C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\MSMAPI\1043\SCANPST.EXE`
for the Dutch version.
