# Screen recording

You can record your screen with the default installed applications on a Microsoft Windows. There's no need to install any additional software!

There's 2 different ways, with 2 different tools which are already installed by default. There's the `Nvidia Experience` and with the `Microsoft XBox tool`. 

The `Nvidia Experience` tool doesn't record the mouse cursor and is probably to most optimized tool to record you screen. This tool is probably the best to use while recording games. You start the tool with the command: `ALT+Z`.

The `Microsoft XBox tool` record the mouse cursor and you can start the tool with `WIN+G`.
