# Password reset on Microsoft Windows 98, XP, Vista, 7, 2008

[ntpasswd](http://pogostick.net/%7Epnh/ntpasswd/) (chntpw) is a tool to reset your user password when your are completely locked out of your Microsoft Windows 98 XP, Vista, 7.

[ntpasswd](http://pogostick.net/%7Epnh/ntpasswd/) (chntpw) is an open source utility, eventually a bootable CD if you go that way, to reset a Microsoft Windows system where you are unable to log in anymore. Microsoft Windows (Vista and 7) have different tools to aid you to recover your lost password. Somethings you can restore via a floppy disk or via an USB key. This require that you have created such recovery system! Microsoft Windows also show up some \"hint\", that you must have filled in, to aid you to remember your password. Believe it or not, you are still able to get stuck on an machine where you wouldn\'t be able to log in :)

There are different GNU/Linux live CD\'s that include this password reset utility. A GNU/Linux live CD is a bootable GNU/Linux environment that you can boot into. You don\'t need to install anything to your hard disk drive. Such a type of bootable live cd is comparable to some Windows environment where you can start other applications in. Mostly, this is about utilities that would aid you when you\'re in troubles. I won\'t go deeper into that subject but just remember that you can take a look to [Knoppix](http://www.knoppix.net), [ultimate boot
CD](http://www.ultimatebootcd.com), [sysresccd](http://www.sysresccd.org), Hiren\'s boot CD. These tools can save your day! The Hiren\'s boot CD must be one of the best, but sadly enough i guess this is all about illegal, non-license compliant software. Many well known commercial payware utilities are available on that boot CD, but you just don\'t pay anythin?!

I recommend to download the bootable image and burn that to a CD. As this is an image file, don\'t drag and drop that image file to an empty CD in your burning software like you would do when creating a data CD. An image file must be burned like an image file. Document you if you don\'t know what this is about. You can also create a bootable USB system if you want. See the official website of ntpasswd: [http://pogostick.net/\~pnh/ntpasswd/](http://pogostick.net/%7Epnh/ntpasswd/) to download the needed data.

Once you made your bootable CD (or USB), it is a matter to adjust your BIOS settings. So that you will be able to boot from a bootable media (CD or USB depending of the choice you made). Once booted, you need to follow the instructions on screen. Note that in this environment, the keyboard layout is in azerty! Also note that the ntpasswd boot CD boot up your system in a command line environment. Don\'t expect fancy graphics it\'s all about a plain text here! At this stage, it\'s just a matter to follow the onscreen instructions. You will see that you have different options you can select. Where one is to reset the passowrd of a user you have selected. Don\'t forget to save (write to disk) your changes. After all, this just looks much more complicated to do as it may look like!

Now, your day should be saved, as well as some money!
