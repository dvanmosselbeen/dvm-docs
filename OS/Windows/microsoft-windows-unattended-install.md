If you want to automate a Microsoft Windows installation, you can make
use of an unattended procedure. It take a bit work to get the job done.
It is not a 20 minutes process. But you will quick discover that it may
help much to reinstall a box quick and with some pre installed
applications.

See <http://unattended.msfn.org/> for more information and the whole
procedure to follow.

*See also the old paper notes. And these notes should be append here.*
