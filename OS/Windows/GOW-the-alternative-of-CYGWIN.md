# GOW the alternative of CYGWIN

GOW (GNU On Windows) is a lightweight alternative to [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com). GOW make use of the NSIS Installer system to install over 100 (open source) UNIX tools compiled as native win32 binaries on your Microsoft Windows system. The main goal is to make the UNIX environment as leightweight as possible. A Cygwin install can end up pretty big, but that depend of all the tools you have installed. GOW, however, seems to be really minimalistic, see the list of [executables files here](https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/wiki/executables_list).

I didn't test GOW so far, sorry, i\'m still a Cygwin user. But a "GOW" environment, seems not appropriated for a developer. GOW doesn't provide any compilers nor development tools. Not that i'm a true developer, but still like to play with software while learning or testing stuff.

For more information see the [GOW website](https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/wiki).
