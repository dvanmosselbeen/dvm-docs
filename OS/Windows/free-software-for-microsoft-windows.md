# Free software for Microsoft Windows

## Introduction


This page mostly talk and link to Open Source applications, freeware or
any software that can be used without paying to use them. This page
isn\'t a reference and link to sites where illegal software can be
downloaded! The title of this page is a bit confussing and you should
know that this list could contains some software that which require some
payment, but it will excplicitely noted!

This page are informative for the commercial O.S. Microsoft Windows.
This page here are created to show that there exist some alternatives to
some commercial products. These alternatives are Open Sources, Freeware
projects! This software here are only Open Source or Freeware. Like i
not use anymore an commercial O.S. i can not give many support of these
applications here. If there are other great Open Source software, let it
me know, so i add it here in these list.

As i\'m not running a Microsoft Windows operating system on my computer,
it could take some time before i update this page again. But don\'t
worry, this could be a nice advantage\... the need to write down the
names of all that cool stufff.
