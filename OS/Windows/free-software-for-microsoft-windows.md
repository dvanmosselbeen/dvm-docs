# Free software for Microsoft Windows

## Introduction

This page mostly talk and link to Open Source applications, freeware or
any software that can be used without paying to use them. This page
isn't a reference and does not link to sites where illegal software can be
downloaded! The title of this page is a bit confusing and you should
know that this list could contains some software that which require some
payment, but it will explicitly noted!

This page here are created to show that there exist some alternatives to
some commercial products. These alternatives are Open Sources, Freeware
projects! This software here are only Open Source or Freeware. Like i
not use anymore a commercial O.S. i can not give many support of these
applications here. If there are other great Open Source software, let it
me know, so I add it here in these list.
