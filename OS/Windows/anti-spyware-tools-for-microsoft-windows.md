# Anti spyware tools for Microsoft Windows

Sadly enough, Microsoft Windows just fails when it\'s about being secure
on the Internet. I don\'t want to start any operating system war, as i
know most of time, problems are due bad users and bad practices. The bad
part of this side, is that a Windows user doesn\'t have enough with an
anti virus software. It looks like people find that normal, i can\'t
believe. Ok, virus and spyware isn\'t the same thing! But somehow, it
is! It\'s just some kind of variation! Even worse, some peoples even
think they run bad antivirus software because they are still infected!

Also note that if you minimalize your risk, you will get less fast
infected. For example, some user who logged in with administrator rights
to surf on the Internet is just doing somethings very bad. Even if it\'s
still abnormal to get viruses, spyware, trojans etc, you should take in
mind that a virus or whatever just can take the rights you have. This
means, if you have write access to system files, a virus under you
profile can infect your whole system in less than you could think of. By
using your operating system the correct way, will avoid you already
lot\'s of \"basic\" issues.

## Spybot search and destroy

Spybot Search and Destroy, also know as Spybot S&D, is for my part, the
best tool there is on the market at the moment. Well, i didn\'t define,
moment, because that moment take long time. Anyway, it does it job
correctly and over all it\'s free to use! What can you expect more?

## malwarebytes

If not better as spybot search and destroy, then it must get the second
place. There\'s a freeware version aswell as a payware version. The
payware version has a realtime proactive protection and a few more
features. But the freeware version should enought. Your antivirus should
do the realtime protection anyway.
