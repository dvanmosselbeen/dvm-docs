This article talk about command line interface tips and tricks on a Microsoft
Windows operating system. Yah, the cli of Microsoft Windows isn\'t that
complex as it is in many other operating systems. Nor are there many
tools to make you pleasant in your cli. Microsoft just see all graphical
user interfaces everywhere.

This article will just resume a few things, it can\'t be complete nor
detail every aspect of the command line interface. Many cool command
line tools needs to be installed separately. Like for example these
tools Sysinternal offer.

Getting started
===============

To get started, you need to open that Command DOS interface. By going
into the `Start menu > Execute`, or simply by pressing the
shortcut key window+r and then following by entering **cmd** and
confirming by pressing the **Ok** button. This will pop up some black
windows.

If you messed with your user setting, it could be that the cmd just
launch in full screen mode. This can be useful on other operating
system, but honesty, it isn\'t on a Microsoft Windows box.

Some applications
=================

There isn\'t that many of cool command line interface programs. Most of
the administration needs to be done throught graphical user interface.
Which is ok to do for a basic user. But sometimes you just want to get a
shell with all it\'s power. This for several reasons such as remote
administration but especially for scripting purpose.
