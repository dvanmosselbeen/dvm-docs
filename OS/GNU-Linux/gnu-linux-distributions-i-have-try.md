# GNU/Linux distributions i have try

This is a little list of the distribution that i have tested. Actually,
this list are really not good set up and very not complete\...I must
good thing from where i have started and where i have derived to.

Before i had begin to try some \'`GNU/Linux`\' distributions, i must
tell you a little bit my past. Before i begin to play with the real nice
stuff, i have made a good background information of how another
commercial operating system \'`Microsoft`\' works. Where i have started
with DOS 5.0 and with my first Windows, the version of \'3.11\' on my
little \'IBM 486\' in the year of 1999. I have used a computer before
that but it was really not the same things\... So like i really like
computing, i hope it\'s not necessary to say that i have see many
different version. I have also used DOS :-) But at that time, there was
not really many other things to play with it.

On that time i liked to use DOS and that Win 3.11. Many times i was
playing with my DOS on that old computer that i have been received. Also
many times the people was launching at my because i liked to play with
that old computer and with his old software. I was happy enough that i
have receive an computer and some people not understand the problem when
there are no money. Finally i\'m been pleasant now that i have been
played with that old nice stuff that have learn me many little things.

- [RedHat](http//www.redhat.com): This is one of my first worked
    distrubution that i have use and have luck to install. It was really
    easy to install. But its because i have try another more complicated
    distro before. The first version of Red hat that i have use, i
    can\'t remember with version it was, it was some times before this
    switched to a pure commercial thing that we must pay to use it. I
    have use it a bit more than a year i think before the great changes.
    Then we had to pay to receive the same services. So i was switched
    from another commercial thing to somethings to now was also only
    available after a payment. Another point with what i was not happy,
    was the 6 months reinstall a new. So that we had to reinstall at
    least on a year, after that the old version was not but upgradable.
    
- [Fedora Core](<http://fedoraproject.org/>): Because Red Hat has
    switched to a payed system and not provide anymore for free, i had
    to move to the Fedora project, wish is become the Free distro of the
    Red Hat project.

- [Gentoo](<http://www.gentoo.org/>): I found his documentation
    very well. I have spend a lots of time to try to configure
    somethings with many fails. It was really complicated to setup a box
    with Gentoo. It take really mush time because its packed we must
    compile it. With the manual by the hand, it was to do it, but takes
    time. A day a have luck to complete to whole compiling task with
    following the manual line at line. Then whem the install was finish,
    i have use it for less than a month. I found i very sad to compile
    each packet. So i had decided to continue looking somethings for me.

- [debian (Woody)](http://www.debian.org/): I can not remember the
    first time when i have used it. I remember that when i have used it
    was at his Woody version. I found in not very well. But it\'s more
    because it was complicate to install it. And i had many things that
    i could not setup directly.

- [Knoppix](<http://www.knoppix.org/>): I find this very well.
    It\'s a live cd that we can install on the hard disk drive. But
    essentially run from CD ROM. Little bit slow due running from CD
    ROM, but theres a solution, install on HDD. It\'s based on
    \'Debian\'. Great hardware detection and very useful to find it when
    others have not found it. There are also many tools for the admin.

- [Mandrake Linux](<http://www.mandriva.com/>): Is build by French
    peoples. I have try i for a little time, it was nice, but not what i
    was looking for. I not search a distribution that i have to
    reinstall every 6 months because there is a great change and a new
    one.

- [SimpleMepis](<http://www.mepis.org/>): Another that i have found
    very well at for hardware detection, but also very limited.

- [Ubuntu](<http://www.ubuntu.com/>): On the first impression i
    found it very well. After trying it while, i found it less very
    well. Ok, recent packages, but a limited one. He use \'Gnome\'.

- [Kubuntu](<http://www.kubuntu.org/>): A little bit the same case
    a \'Ubuntu\'.

- [Suse](http://en.opensuse.org/) : A really beautiful distribution! I
    use i some time, but i must say it that i have not give many time to
    it. It\'s on the same time that i have begin with Debian. And i like
    it really more.

- [Debian](http://www.debian.org/): Currently i use Debian because i
    really like all what he does do. I can not point to somethings
    particular or say precisely what i like exactly of debian or i must
    be write the biggest book never written.
- [System Rescue](http://www.sysresccd.org/): This is not a
    distribution, there are one on this cd. But this boot cd have many
    stuff that help all the admins. Partitionnering tools, hardware info
    tools, backup tools, \...

So i don\'t know if now i must by speak of all the distribution that i
have testa day but without using it for a minimal time of 3 months.
Like`Solaris`,`Damn Small Linux`.
