# XChat

## Introduction

XChat is a very to use GUI IRC client. Probably a tool for geeks.

If you don't know what an IRC client is, then you probably don't know what an ICR network is. Basically it's a system to get in touch with other people so that you can chat. 

## Tweaks i like

`Interface` > `Text box` > `Time Stamps` - Check the option `Enable time stamps` and adjust the content of the field `Time Stamp format` to

    [%D-%H:%M]
