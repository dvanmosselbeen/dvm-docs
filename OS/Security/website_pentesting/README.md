This is an Operating  System made with on purpose full of vulnerabilities, not only the system,  but also the extra tools they have installed on it. This is to test out and exercise.

Currently, the following topics:

* [dirb](dirb.md) - A tool to scan in a website and find out all files that we are normally not able to visit or be aware of it. It works based on a wordlist file. Usage example: dirb http://10.0.2.7/mutillidae -o dirb_output
* [weevely](weevely.md) - Abuse File Upload Vulnerabilities. A tool to create a PHP backdoor and try to obtain a shell trough a php script.
* `dirbuster` - Similar to dirb but with a cooler name, and with a user interface.
* `gobuster` - Directory/file & DNS busting tool written in Go
* `nikto` - web server security scanner - nikto is a popular web scanning tool that allows users to find common web vulnerabilities. It is commonly used to check for common CVE's such as shellshock, and to get general information about the web server that you're enumerating.
