## Introduction

`gobuster` is not installed by default on a Kali box.

## Getting help

* `gobuster help` - General help.
* `gobuster help <mode>` - Outputs the help specific to that mode. For example `gobuster help dir` which will output the help about webserver scanning.

## Using Gobuster

```commandline
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.206.175:8080 -o gobuster_scan_result
```

```
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.105.186:3333 -e
```

An important Gobuster switch is the -x switch, which can be used to look for files with specific extensions. For example, if you added -x php,txt,html to your Gobuster command, the tool would append .php, .txt, and .html to each word in the selected wordlist, one at a time. This can be very useful if you've managed to upload a payload and the server is changing the name of uploaded files.

The `gobuster` output (look into the `gobuster_scan_result` we asked to create):

```commandline
/development          (Status: 301) [Size: 320] [--> http://10.10.206.175/development/]
/server-status        (Status: 403) [Size: 301]
```
