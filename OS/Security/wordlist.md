## Introduction

There are different wordlist out there, the most popular one is the `rockyou.txt` file which is available trough the package `wordlists`. See in `/usr/share/wordlists`.

But take also a look to the SecLists, https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists - apt-get install seclist Which contains various wordlists. Very interesting to see is that there's a dedicated sub-folder (on github) called passwords/Leaked-Databases where different kind of passwords lists are stored.
