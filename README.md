# A note about my notes

**Here you go already with a strange title :-D**

This is just a bunch of notes and config files I made for my needs. During late evenings, with or without a beer after a long day. 

These notes are in `Markdown` format. Some notes here are very old, pre year 2006. These notes I wrote where originally on my website during the last 15-20 years. They were into my databases / websites and custom systems, which I converted over and over again these last years. *Be warned if you see some messed up markup in these notes* :-D

These notes are absolutely not complete at all. These are not HOWTO's or tutorials. Although some topics might be pretty elaborated, but for some others, I was just tired to write it down. I'm not Google after all.

Feel free to use them, or co-work (`pull-request`) if you have time and motivation for this ;-)

Enjoy,

Peace & Love

David
